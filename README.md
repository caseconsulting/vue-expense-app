## Setup

The **Expense Application** is written in **Vue.js** and relies on **Node.js** v8.x+ and the **yarn** package management system.

* Download and install Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/
* Download and install yarn from: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
* Install required Node.js modules:

```
yarn install
```

## Environment variables

In order to use **Auth0** authentication, you will need to define four environment variables:

* **VUE_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID**
* **VUE_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN**
* **VUE_APP_HOSTNAME**
* **VUE_APP_AUTH0_API_ID**

**vue-cli** automatically picks up environment variables in `.env` files. Therefore, you can store these variables in a `.env.local` file in the project root directory. `.env.local.sample` is an example of how this file should look. The `.env.local` file in the **case-expense-app** S3 bucket in the company AWS account has up-to-date values for the environment variables. Download this file to the project root directory:

```
aws s3 cp s3://case-expense-app/.env.local .env.local
```
